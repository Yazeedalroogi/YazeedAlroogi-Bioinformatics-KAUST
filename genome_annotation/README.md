LOG FOR GENOME ANNOTATION


1) The peptide KVRMFTSELDIMLSVNGPADQIKYFCRHWT* includes 31 amino acids exclusing the start and stop codon. If the start codon is considered, then the number would be 32. This can be confirmed using BASH bu running the command "echo "KVRMFTSELDIMLSVNGPADQIKYFCRHWT" | wc -c" which outputs 31.

The open reading frame includes codons for the 31 amino acids as well as a start codon and a stop codon, thus it has a total of 33 codons. Since each codon is made up of 3 bases, the open reading frame contains 99 bases on a single strand.
